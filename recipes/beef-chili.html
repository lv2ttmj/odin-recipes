        <h2 class="steps subhead">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn the heat to high.</li>
            <li>When the beef begins to sizzle, break it into small pieces 
            with a potato masher or spatula. Meat can be broken up into fine 
            crumbles or larger chunks, depending on preference. Continue to cook 
            and break up the beef until it is no longer pink, which will take around 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chili powder, chipotle, black pepper, salt, and cinnamon to the pot. Cook, stirring 
                for one minute, then pour in beer.</li>
            <li>Stir, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pot as you do.
                Let the mixture boil until the liquid is reduced by about half, which will take around 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add sugar, oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes, and jarred salsa. Stir in and return the mixture to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir in the beans, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until the chili is thickened and flavor is developed to liking, which can take around an hour.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning. Top with the toppings as desired.</li>
        </ol>
