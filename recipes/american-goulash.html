        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a pot over medium-high heat. 
                Add your ground beef and onion, cooking and 
                stirring until the beef is browned and the onion is 
                translucent, which will take around 5 minutes. Continue 
                to cook and stir until the liquid is evaporated.</li>
            <li>Add your garlic, bay leaves, paprika, italian seasoning,
                salt, black pepper, and cayenne and cook, stirring occasionally
                for about 3 minutes.</li>   
            <li>Pour in your broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water
                into the sauce jar, swirl those together and then pour it into the pot.
                Stir in soy sauce, and bring it to a simmer. Reduce the heat to
                medium and simmer for about 30 minutes.</li>   
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and stir in the macaroni. Stir occasionally
                until just barely tender, which will take around 12 minutes. Check again
                after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and remove the bay leaves. Stir in cheese and parsley. Cover
                and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>  
        </ol>
